            <p class="p1">
                <strong>
                English: -  I want to improve my grades in English by enhancing my
                 Vocabulary more to improve my writing skills. I will be doing so by reading/re reading books and 
                 make a vocabulary list which would consist of all the new words I find. 
                 I will then incorporate them in my works so that I get more used to them.  Time I will take is 1 month.  
                 The support I require is from my teacher which would be in the form of giving me feedback so 
                 that I will know whether I am improving or not. </strong>
            </p>

            <p class="p1">
                <strong>
                I&S: -  I want to score better in I&S criterion B.  I will do this by reading and following the strands of 
                criterion B in I&S more carefully and practice previous yearâ€™s SAs and FAs for revision. Time I will take is 1 month. 
                The support I require is from my teacher which would be in the form of giving me feedback so that I 
                will know whether I am improving or not.</strong>
            </p>

            <p class="p1">
                <strong>
            MFL: -   I want to develop fluency in my chosen language in MFL (Hindi) I will do this by doing daily reading and noting down new words 
            from the resources Sunil Sir shares with us. Time I will take is 1 Month.  The support I require is from my teacher which 
            would be in the form of giving me feedback so that I will know whether I am improving or not. </strong>
            </p>

            <h2 class="title">Overall Goals:</h2>

            <p class="p1">
                <strong>
                Goal 1: - My Goal is to prepare for the PSAT exam which I must give in either grade 8 or 9. 
                My strategy 
                to prepare for the exam is to do online courses from websites 
                like YouTube, Khan Academy, and practice their courses and attempt practice questions. Time I will
            take is 5-6 Months, and I do not require any support.</strong>
            </p>

            <p class="p1">
                <strong>
                Goal 2: - My goal is to resume my physical fitness which I stopped due to the rising cases. My 
                strategies to do the same will be going downstairs and walk/jog for 2 hours straight. Since the cases are rising, 
                I cannot continue doing my 
                sport activities for a while, so this is the best alternative along with doing exercise indoors. Time I will take is 2 Months and I do 
            not require any support.  </strong>
            </p>

            <p class="p1">
                <strong>
                Goal 3: - I want to work on my diet and consume healthy food more often. My strategies 
                for doing so will be to visit 
                the website eatthismuch.com and prepare a healthy diet plan for myself and then follow it every day.
            The time I require is 1 month and the only support I require from my parents is that they bring me the food 
            items the website suggested if the meals are not available at home.</strong>
