                Communicator: - I developed the Learner Profile
            Communicator in this term because of Enrichment Clusters, where we worked as a group on a single
        product. Because of our effective cooperation and communicator about the roles and work divided, 
    we were able to pull it off, with me developing this learner profile too. </strong>

                <strong>
                Knowledgeable: - I developed the Learner Profile
            Knowledgeable in maths this term because I learned many things which were sort of new to me, for example
        simple/compound interest which I studied little about before in my life.</strong>

                <strong>
                Research Skills: - I developed the ATL Skill
            Research in this term because of Math Summative Unit 1, where we had to make an entire presentation
            by researching on a whole budget, financial planning for which we had to research on different websites,
            taxes, bank interests, etc. </strong>

                <strong>
                Thinking Skills: - I developed the ATL Skill
            Thinking in this term because of I&S Summative Unit 2 as we had to make an entire report/presentation on
            a chosen case study/natural disaster and suggest an innivative plan to solve it. While thinking on the innovative plan,
            I developed thinking skills.. </strong>
