                <strong>
                    I won the brown 1 karate belt on 17th of November in a belt test organized by my teachers in karate last year in 2021. They tested me on the basis of my knowledge on Katha’s, how well I can kick and punch, and at last, how good I am at sparring. They graded me on those categories and I scored well, because of which I won the belt.  </strong>
